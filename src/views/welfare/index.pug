				| Welcome to the Welfare section of the JCR website!
				| Hopefully this website will be a good resource for you, but it is no
				| substitute for having a chat with somebody. We're always around to
				| talk - feel free to get in touch. You can visit us in the welfare room,
				| or use our anonymous online support system.

				h3(class="ui header") How does College Welfare Work?
				p
					| University can be a very exciting time, but it also can be really
					| daunting and unnerving. Though people might be very happy most of
					| the time, there are sometimes those who are not. That's where the
					| college welfare team come in. We provide a confidential, non-advisory,
					| listening, signposting, and support service to allow you to come and
					| talk to another student. You can talk to the welfare team about
					| literally anything, even if you just fancy a chat. We also have loads
					| of information leaflets and we can point you in the right direction
					| if you need contact details for hospitals, clinics or professional
					| advice.
				p
					| The team also organise and run campaign weeks in college like SHAG
					| (Sexual Health and Guidance) week, Substance Awareness week, and
					| Mental Health Awareness Week. The aim of these is to promote
					| awareness of various issues, and provide members of college with
					| useful information.

				h3(class="ui header") How do you find us?
				p
					| We run drop-in hours 3 times a week, in the evening/afternoon,
					| during which anyone can drop in to talk to the team member on duty
					| about anything, in confidence. Welfare hours are held in the Welfare
					| Room which is located on the bottom floor of Hollingside, opposite
					| the laundry room. They are held on Tuesday and Thursday 6.30-8.30pm
					| and Saturday 2-4pm. You can find out which member of the team is
					| running the drop-ins by looking at the rota which is emailed out to
					| college.
				p
					| We can also be found on Facebook at
					| <a href="https://www.facebook.com/greycollegewelfare/" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/greycollegewelfare/</a>
					| and on instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/greywelfare/" target="_blank">www.instagram.com/greywelfare/</a>.
				p
					| So make sure you all look out for the Welfare team: we are here to
					| support you anytime you need it, to make sure everyone enjoys their
					| university experience as much as they can.
			div(class="ui vertical segment")
				h3(class="ui header") Anonymous Online Support system
				p
					| You can use the anonymous online support system to send an anonymous
					| message to the Male and Female Welfare Officers from whom you should
					| receive a reply from within 24 hours. Click
					| <a href="https://community.dur.ac.uk/grey.welfare/" target="_blank">here</a>
					| to access this service. You could report an incident (such as egging,
					| drink spiking) to enable us to warn other students about it. You
					| could ask us a question if you prefer not to talk directly. Or you
					| can simply use it as an easy way of sending us your thoughts. Here
					| are a few of the things you might want to write about:
				ul
					li Request information like leaflets, names of charities, phone numbers etc.
					li Tell us you#{"'"}d like to see more coverage of a certain issue, illness or disability.
					li Let us know you are worried about a friend.
					li Suggest how we could improve campaign weeks (SHAG week, Stressless, Alcohol Awareness)
					li Request certain supplies, and we can leave it in a discreet place for you.
				h4(class="ui header") Pregnancy Testing
				p
					| Free pregnancy tests can be taken from the welfare room at any time
					| during drop in. The test is very simple and only takes a few minutes.
					| Please contact the anonymous online support system if you would like
					| a test out of drop in hours or would like them to help you.
				h4(class="ui header") Chlamydia Testing
				p
					| In the same way we offer free chlamydia tests - these can be done in
					| your own time and dropped down to the Durham SU. Results come back
					| quite quickly. We have an awareness week when we encourage people to
					| get the test done, but you can get one at any time from the welfare
					| room.
				h4(class="ui header") Condoms
				p
					| Condoms and lube are both free, and are available in a range of
					| sizes and types, including female and latex-free. They can be picked
					| up in drop-ins, from the box outside the Welfare room out of hours,
					| or by messaging the anonymous online support system.
			div(class="ui vertical segment")
				h3(class="ui header") Getting involved in Welfare
				p
					| Would you like to get involved in welfare? Whilst at Durham, there
					| are several opportunities to get involved in welfare: be at Grey,
					| through Nightline or Durham SU.
				h4(class="ui header") College Welfare team
				p
					| The new Welfare team will be picked during the second term of the
					| year (Epiphany). The Male and Female Welfare Officers will also be
					| elected during Epiphany term and anyone who would like to run for
					| the roles can stand for either Male or Female Welfare Officer.
				p
					| If you would like to apply to be on the Welfare team or run for the
					| role as a Welfare Officer â€“ feel free to get in touch with the
					| current team to answer any questions you might have.
				h4(class="ui header") Nightline
				p
					| Nightline is a listening service run by students for students and is
					| open every night of term between 9pm and 7am. They are there to
					| listen to you about anything on your mind such as friends,
					| relationships, stress, late night thoughts, and more.
				p
					| Nightline is based on 5 principles: confidentiality, anonymity,
					| non-advisory, non-judgmental, and non-aligned. So, you can be ensured
					| that every conversation remains between the caller and volunteer and
					| that your identity will remain anonymous. As well, they are
					| non-directive/non-advisory respecting your right to make your own
					| decisions, and are both non-judgmental and non-aligned respecting
					| each person's thoughts, beliefs, and actions.
				p
					| You can contact them by calling their number which is found on DUO
					| and the back of your campus card or online via their instant
					| messaging system which can be found on their website:
					| <a href="https://durhamnightline.com/" target="_blank">durhamnightline.com</a>
