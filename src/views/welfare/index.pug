				| Welcome to the Welfare section of the JCR website! 
				| Hopefully this website will be a good resource for you, but it is no 
				| substitute for having a chat with somebody. We're always around to 
				| talk - feel free to get in touch. You can visit us in the welfare room, 
				| or use our anonymous online support system.

				h3(class="ui header") How does College Welfare Work?
				p
					| University can be a very exciting time, but it also can be really 
					| daunting and unnerving. Though people might be very happy most of 
					| the time, there are sometimes those who are not. That's where the 
					| college welfare team come in. We provide a confidential, non-advisory, 
					| listening, signposting, and support service to allow you to come and 
					| talk to another student. You can talk to the welfare team about 
					| literally anything, even if you just fancy a chat. We also have loads 
					| of information leaflets and we can point you in the right direction 
					| if you need contact details for hospitals, clinics or professional 
					| advice. 
				p
					| The team also organise and run campaign weeks in college like SHAG 
					| (Sexual Health and Guidance) week, Substance Awareness week, and 
					| Mental Health Awareness Week. The aim of these is to promote 
					| awareness of various issues, and provide members of college with 
					| useful information.

				h3(class="ui header") How do you find us?
				p
					| We run drop-in hours 3 times a week, in the evening/afternoon, 
					| during which anyone can drop in to talk to the team member on duty 
					| about anything, in confidence. Welfare hours are held in the Welfare 
					| Room which is located on the bottom floor of Hollingside, opposite 
					| the laundry room.They are held on Tuesday and Thursday 6.30-8.30pm 
					| and Saturday 2-4pm. You can find out which member of the team is 
					| running the drop-ins by looking at the rota which is emailed out to 
					| college. 
				p
					| We can also be found on Facebook at 
					| <a href="https://www.facebook.com/greycollegewelfare/" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/greycollegewelfare/</a> 
					| and on instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/greywelfare/" target="_blank">www.instagram.com/greywelfare/</a>.
				p

					| support you anytime you need it, to make sure everyone enjoys their 
					| university experience as much as they can.

					| service. You could report an incident (such as egging, drink spiking) 
					| to enable us to warn other students about it. You could ask us a

					| it as an easy way of sending us your thoughts. Here are a few of the 
					| things you might want to write about:

					| open every night of term between 9pm and 7am. They are there to 
					| listen to you about anything on your mind such as friends, 
					| relationships, stress, late night thoughts, and more.
				p
					| Nightline is based on 5 principles: confidentiality, anonymity, 
					| non-advisory, non-judgmental, and non-aligned. So, you can be ensured 
					| that every conversation remains between the caller and volunteer and 
					| that your identity will remain anonymous. As well, they are 
					| non-directive/non-advisory respecting your right to make your own 
					| decisions, and are both non-judgmental and non-aligned respecting 
					| each person's thoughts, beliefs, and actions.
				p
					| You can contact them by calling their number which is found on DUO 
					| and the back of your campus card or online via their instant 
					| messaging system which can be found on their website: 
					| <a href="https://durhamnightline.com/" target="_blank">durhamnightline.com</a>
