				h3(class="ui header") About the MCR
				p The MCR is the community for all postgraduates in Grey College, and supports and provides facilities for them. It is also the informal name for the Phoenix Room, located in the Elvet block, which is the postgraduate common room. One of the main benefits of MCR membership is access to the MCR common room, which acts as the social hub for all members living in or out of college. Along with being a great place to just hang out and chat with friends, the common room also offers:
				ul
					li Free tea/coffee/squash and biscuits
					li A projector and surround sound system
					li DVD player, Xbox 360, and Wii U
					li A large DVD and games library

				p From film nights to formals, the MCR organises a wide variety of events throughout the year, catering to everyone's interests. What’s more, it’s an opportunity for you to put forward any ideas or suggestions which are always welcome. There is a comprehensive calendar of events, both in and out of term time, designed to bring together all common room members, provide a social aspect to the postgraduate community and raise the profile of the MCR within college.

				p More information about the MCR can be found on <a href="https://community.dur.ac.uk/grey.mcr/">the MCR website</a>.
