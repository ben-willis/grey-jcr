				p 
					| Second years are assigned a College Mentor. This is someone 
					| who is appointed to help with personal development.
				p 
					| The College also has a Parenting system where a fresher is 
					| paired with a student from a later year who acts as someone 
					| they can approach for help or advice about academic work, or 
					| information on what goes on in college. They are also someone 
					| you can socialise with and who can introduce you to people 
					| in other years.
				p 
					| Subject groups are an exciting new addition to college life, 
					| giving you the means to get to know others in college studying 
					| your subject, share advice between year groups, and have a 
					| point of contact who can connect you with other students. 
					| It’s an opportunity to learn from more experienced students, 
					| for older years to share interests in their subject and help 
					| guide other students.
				p 
					| Every subject has a point of contact called the Subject Leader,
					| a motivated student passionate about their subject. They’ll be
					| able to recommend modules, career paths, give essay advice,
					| and pass on contacts between different students studying the
					| same subject. You’ll meet you Subject Leaders in the first week
					| of term (after Freshers’ Week) and get a chance to get to know
					| older students doing your course and find out what it’s like
					| after first year.
				p
					| The Assistant Master (Welfare), Julie Bushby (julie.bushby@durham.ac.uk)
					| is someone who students are able to approach for advice or help
					| on academic or other issues.

					| events, raise awareness and provide a signposting role allowing
					| the individuals from these groups extra support and ensuring
					| their views are heard. Grey is committed to ensuring all members
					| of the JCR can be involved in all parts of college, and this
					| committee is a vital part in making sure all JCR members are
					| welcomed and find their home in Grey.

					| please feel free to contact them. Any general queries please
